## Build multi-device-site

### Project Details

In this project I have created my first simple product landing page that works across a large range of devices, form-factors, and screen sizes.

### What I have learned in this project: 

1. Sketch out Information Architecture (IA) for narrow and wide viewports;
2. Create a skeleton view of the page with content then styling it;
3. Create base experience around mobile-first approach;
